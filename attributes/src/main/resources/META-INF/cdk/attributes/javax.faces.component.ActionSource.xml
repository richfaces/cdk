            MethodExpression representing the application action to invoke
            when this component is activated by the user.
            The expression
            must evaluate to a public method that takes no parameters, and
            returns an Object (the toString() of
            which is called to derive
            the logical outcome) which is passed to the NavigationHandler
            for this application.

            MethodExpression representing an action listener method that
            will be notified when this component
            is activated by the user.
            The expression must evaluate to a public method that takes an
            ActionEvent parameter, with a
            return type of void, &lt;span
            class="changed_added_2_0"&gt;or to a public method that takes no
            arguments with a return
            type of void. In the latter case, the
            method has no way of easily knowing where the event came from,
            but this can be
            useful in cases where a notification is needed
            that "some action happened".&lt;/span&gt;

            Flag indicating that, if this component is activated by the user,
            notifications should be delivered to
            interested listeners and actions
            immediately (that is, during Apply Request Values phase) rather than
            waiting until
            Invoke Application phase.

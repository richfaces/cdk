        <description>
            MethodExpression representing the application action to invoke
            when this component is activated by the user.
            The expression
            must evaluate to a public method that takes no parameters, and
            returns an Object (the toString() of
            which is called to derive
            the logical outcome) which is passed to the NavigationHandler
            for this application.
